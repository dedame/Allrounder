Allrounder Custom Rotation for ExileBuddy

Hey Everyboddy,
this custom rotation is designed and written by xTenshiSanx (me).
It provides a generic and individual combatrotation for everybody without changing anything directly in the code.
The best is so nobody could destroy the code accidentally.

The Rotation is Characterspecific so its not a general rotation, you dont have to change the rotation for every character.
Just setup the Settingsfile in the Settings\Allrounder folder CHARACTERNAME.cfg

The working variables for the settingsfile are

(string) Name
(int) MinManaPercent
(int) MinLifePercent
(int) Mobsarround_Distance
(int) Mobsarround_Count
(int) Mobsarround_Target // 0 Ma(int)arget // 1 Me
(int) EnemyDistance
(int) MaxCount

(bool) CheckForMobsarround
(bool) OnlyBosses
(bool) IsTrap
(bool) IsSummon
(bool) IsCurse
